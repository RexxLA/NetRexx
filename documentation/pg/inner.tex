\chapter{Translator inner workings}

The translator source is part of the package
\keyword{org.netrexx.process}, located in the \keyword{./src/org/netrexx/process} directory of the git repository.\\
The runtime support, including the \keyword{Rexx} type, is in the package \keyword{netrexx.lang} in \keyword{./src/netrexx/lang}.

This chapter documents the inner workings of the
translator. Its purpose is to assist with debugging
serious problems or ease the introduction to the toolset for
programmers who want to help the open source effort forwards.

To delve deeper into the inner workings of the translator, you are encouraged to read the \nr{} source files,
a great resource to discover the language's potential.\\ Also take a look at Kermit Kiser's
\keyword{./documentation/pg/NetRexxCLogic.odg}
Open Document Graphics file, and the \nr{} UML diagrams at \keyword{./examples/uml}.
Finally, running the translator with -diag and -verbose5 arguments is very informative.


\section{Translating, compiling and interpreting}
The translator (see \keyword{RxTranslator.nrx}) passes four times through the \nr{} source files.
\begin{itemize}
    \item pass 0 : tokenises the source and parses prolog (options, package and import statements) and
 class instructions
    \item pass 1 : processes resolution of properties and methods
    \item pass 2 : parses method bodies and generates Java code
    \item pass 3 : code interpretation
    \item pass 4 : code compilation
\end{itemize}
Pass 3 and 4 are mutually exclusive, the presence of the \keyword{-exec} argument triggers interpretation
as pass 3 (see \keyword{RxInterpreter.nrx}),
otherwise the generated Java source code is compiled into Java class file(s) as pass 4.


Generally, the translator source files can be categorised in two sections.
\keyword{Nr*.nrx} files are implementations
of the \keyword{RxClauseParser} interface, which all define the following methods
\begin{enumerate}
    \item scan(), called three times (pass 0, 1 and 2), lexical syntax scan of the \nr{} clause
    \item getAssigns(), returns names of variables which received new values, mostly null
    \item generate(), generates Java source code from the \nr{} clause during pass 4
    \item interpret(), interprets the \nr{} clause, called by \keyword{RxInterpreter.nrx} on pass 3
\end{enumerate}

The remaining \keyword{Rx*.nrx} files are supporting input/output streaming, parsing and other translator functionality.


The following tables list all translator source files with their main function.
