/** tcpdata

Simple tcpdata implementation.

linger      - wait a bit before terminating the last read (units SECONDS)
timeout     - wait this long before timing reads out (units MS)
deblock     - If deblock is ommited a copy stage is used.
group       - similiar to cms.  A delimited string containing a stage is
              expected.  You can use a run of stages, but its is dangerous
              since you to know the stage sep character being used...
nodelay     - use the nodelay option
oneresponse - synchronize requests/replies
