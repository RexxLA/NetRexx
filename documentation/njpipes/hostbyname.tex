   HOSTBYNAME - Resolve a Domain Name into an IP Address
   
   The input to HOSTBYNAME is a list of hostnames (possibly qualified by their domain
   name).  For each hostname it determines the corresponding IP address; this information 
   is written to the output stream.  Where multiple IP addresses exist for a given
   name they are written with a 'space' separator.  When the domain or host name cannot be 
   resolved, the input hostname and additional information are written to the output
   stream.

                                      Example:  dns.google/8.8.8.8

   Examples:
   
      pipe "literal dns.google | hostbyname | console"
      8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8
   	  
      pipe "literal dns.google | hostbyname includename | console"
      dns.google/8.8.4.4 dns.google/8.8.8.8
   	  
      pipe "literal www.shaw.ca | hostbyname | console"
      23.6.246.208
   	  
      pipe "literal bogus.bogus | hostbyname | console"
      # Input record 1: Unable to determine IP address for bogus.bogus #								  
									  
   Known issues:  
   
      The underlying Java getAllByName does not appear to handle names that return
      IPv6 addresses in any known and consistent manner.
