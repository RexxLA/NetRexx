/** sort

This sort routine is very basic.  It uses sortRexx class, which implements
the sortClass interface.  To sort objects of classes other than Rexx requires
that you implement another sortClass with a name begining with 'sort'.

I implemented this class using an Java array for the objects to be sorted as
opposed to a Rexx stem.  Using an array is about 50% faster.  I choose a quick/
Bose Norman sort since I had the code, in Rexx, for it from a time before I
had pipes on CMS!
