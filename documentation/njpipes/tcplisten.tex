/** tcplisten

Simple tcplisten implementation.  You can only supply the port and a timeout
value.  Its ignored unless tcplisten's output stream has been severed, in
which case tcplisten terminates.

If input stream 0 is connected, tcplisten does a peekto before calling the
accept method.  The object is consumed after the output of the socket object
returns.
