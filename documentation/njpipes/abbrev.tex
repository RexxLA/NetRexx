\textbf{Type:} Selection Stage

\textbf{Syntax Description:} A word, a number and a keyword are
optional.

The word specifies the characters to compare against the beginning of
input records. The default is a null word. The number specifies the
minimum count of characters that must be present to select the
record. The default is zero, which means that any abbreviation down to
a null record or a leading blank will be selected. Specify ANYCASE to
make the comparison case insensitive. 

\textbf{Operation:}  \emph{abbrev} compares the leading columns of
each record against the specified word until a blank or the end of the
record is met. The record is passed to the primary output stream if a
minimum abbreviation of the specified word is present. Otherwise, the
record is discarded (or passed to the secondary output stream if the
secondary output stream is connected).

\textbf{Example}:
\lstinputlisting[label=abbrev1,caption=abbrev example]{abbrevsample.njp} 
\bash[stdout]
pipe abbrevsample
\END
\bash[stdout]
java abbrev1
\END
