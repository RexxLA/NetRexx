\begin{shaded}
\begin{rail}
  append : 'append' string
  ;
\end{rail}
\end{shaded}

\textbf{Type:} Control

\textbf{Syntax Description:} The argument string is normally a single stage, but any pipeline
specification that can be suffixed by a connector (|*:) is acceptable.

\textbf{Operation:} All records on the primary input stream are copied
to the primary output stream. Then the string is issued as a
subroutine pipeline with CALLPIPE, using the default stage separator
(|), double quotes as the escape character ("), and the backward slash
as the end character. The beginning of the pipeline is
unconnected. The end of the pipeline is connected to appendâ€™s primary
output stream. (Do not write an explicit connector.)

\textbf{Example:}

\lstinputlisting[label=append1,caption=append example]{appendsample.njp} 
\bash[stdout]
pipe appendsample
\END
\bash[stdout]
java appendtest
\END
