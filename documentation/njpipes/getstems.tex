Input stream 0 should contain rexx objects containing stems.  The getstems stage
will output the contents of the stem on stream 0.  If output stream 1 is
connected, the root is placed there.  Any severed streams will cause then
stage to exit.  Passing a non rexx stem object will cause the stage to exit
with return code 13
