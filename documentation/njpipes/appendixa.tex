\begin{verbatim}
.50  - Released May 30, 1999
         - Fixed a stall occurring when interrupted threads, with the interrupt
           caught by ThreadPool, were reused.
         - Fixed a thread safety problem in ELASTIC
         - Improved the timeout options in TCPDATA and TCPCLIENT, they also
           byte[] instead of strings.  This was done since converting to and
           from strings sometimes scrambles binary data (more research on
           encodings...)
         - Changed DELBLOCK it now handles byte[] to help keep tcpdata and
           tcpclient efficient.  The EOF option was broken, its fixed now.
         - Changed DISKR, DISKW and DISKA to handle byte[] when using streams.
         - Added INSERT which handles byte[].  This should be used instead of
           SPECS to add LF or CR .
         - Changes SERIALIZE to use byte[].
   0.49  - Released May 21, 1999
         - compiled with 1.2.1 and NetRexx 1.148
         - Added preliminary support added to .njp compiler for files containing
           java source!  See the (some what messy) java samples in vectort1.njp,
           overtest.njp and addtest4.njp
         - Added code to generate a dummy .nrx file containing the public class
           in a .java file.  This allows NetRexx to compile class that depend on
           the java source.
         - Modified sort to accept arguements in the same order as CMS
         - Fixed rc logic in drop stage
         - Fixed shortcut code for {n} where n is numeric.
   0.48  - Released May 16, 1999
         - Fixed a (nasty) bug involving reusing pipe objects.
         - Added the reuse() method to the stage class.  To use it override
           it in your stage.  It was added so there was a foolproof way to
           reset a stage when its pipe object is reused.  (doSetup is intended
           for use with dynamic arguements in call or added pipes)
         - Added the cont option and defaulted it to comma.
         - fixed return code logic in some stages and in selectInput/Output
         - Added the Emsg methods
         - Added arguement debug option (128)
         - There are no more final methods
         - Much improved error reporting from stages via new Emsg method
   0.47  - Released Jan 3, 1999
         - recompiled with 1.1.7A and netrexx 1.148
         - UNIQUE repaired?
         - Added stages to acess java objects easily
           VECTOR, VECTORR, VECTORW, VECTORA for java.util.vector
           ARRAY, ARRAYR, ARRAYW, ARRAYA for Object[]
           HASH, HASHR, HASHW, HASHA for java.util.Hashtable
           DICT, DICTR, DICTW, DICTA for java.util.Dictionary
           The hash stages mostly map directly to DICT stages.  The exception
           is HASHW which uses the clear() method of Hashtable.
         - Modified LITERAL to be able to put any object into a pipe
         - Modified pipe package to store arguements in a hashtable instead of
           a rexx stem - arguements can now be of any class.  Use the arg(null)
           method to get an object arguement.
   0.46a - Released Oct 14, 1998
         - recompiled with 1.1.7
         - TCPLISTEN now supports an input stream to be used to pace accepts

         - COMMAND, CHANGE, FILE, LOCATE, DROP, LOOKUP, TCPCLIENT, TCPLISTEN
           SQLSELECT, CONSOLE, TCPDATA, NOEOFBACK improved.
         - Jeff improved the testing process with the addition of the COMPARE
           stage, he also upgraded many of the tests.
         - Added the buildtests pipe, it builds a test script to be run with:
           test > output < console.data
         - Unexpected exceptions should no longer hang pipes
   0.45  - Released Sept 9, 1998
         * Recompile all your stages.  To fix a commit problem I had to
           change the _stage interface class...
         - tcpclient restart problems with oneresp active fixed.
         - commit now returns the current return code of the pipe.
         - fixed minor errors in tcpclient and diska.
   0.44  - Released Sept 8, 1998
         * a recompile of pipes using STEM is required
         - smart DISK, FILE and STEM stages now exist.
         - Made to and from synonoms for in and out in REXX and STRING stages.
         - Added stream option to DISKR and DISKW to read raw streams.
         - Added DISKSLOW and SERIALIZE stages.
         - Now DISK, DISKR, DISKW, DISKA and DISKSLOW have FILE synonyms.
         - Deadlock detection improvements.
         - TCPDATA & TCPCLIENT optimized once again.
         - selectAnyInput could deadlock - fixed.
         - interrupting a pipe now kills it - use this with care (ie. kill -9)
         - Pseudo methods njpRC() and njpObject() are reconized by the pipes
           compiler and return the pipe's RC or object respectivily.
   0.43  - Released August 30, 1998
         - Fixed deadlock dection to see commit deadlocks.
         - Added rest of code to handle improved StageError logic.
         - Added stage templates (template*.nrx) in the njpipes directory.
         - Added a debug flag (64) to trace all StageError rasied by the
           stage class.
   0.42  - Not released
         * A recompile of pipes using TCPCLIENT, TCPDATA is required.
         * A recompile of pipes using REXX, STRING, ZONE, CASEI is recommended.
         - Updated the comments in _stage to reflect the possible StageError
           and return codes that can be issued.
         - Added the DEBLOCK stage and reworked TCPDATA, TCPCLIENT & GATE.
         - Improved eofReport processing and added a new option 'either' that
           will trigger a StageError when any stream, input or output, severs.
         - Fixed variable subsitution so multiple variables passed to a stage
           will work.
         - Added the ability to pass thru arguements to callpipe and addpipe.
         - Fixed a problem with some StageExits requiring stage_reset methods.
         - Added a function to utils to help assign smarter name to classes
           generated by StageExits.
         - Added counter method to stage.  use to count external waits so
           deadlock/stall detection is not fooled.
   0.41  - Released August 23, 1998
         * removed OBJ2REXX, OBJ2STRING stages, use REXX and STRING stage
           modifiers.
         * pipes using TCPDATA, TCPCLIENT & LOOKUP should be recompiled
         - exhanced REXX stage modifier via an object2rexx improvement in
           pipes/utils.nrx
         - optimized ThreadPool startup times.  No setName and only use
           setPriority when its required.
         - made it possible to optimized stage startup time when arguements
           are static.  See TCPDATA, TCPCLIENT & LOOKUP
         - faq.txt enhanced
   0.40  - Released August 14, 1998
         * All pipes MUST be recompiled.  Old pipe class files will stall.
         - OBJ2REXX is depreciated and will be removed, use the REXX stage.
         - added REXX and STRING stages to convert objects entering and leaving
           a stage to rexx or string.  Inorder to avoid nasty class conflicts,
           REXX and STRING are implemented in _rexx and _string.  The compler
           adds the '_' when necessary (any stage can use this feature).
         - fixed an intermitant stall in callpipe (was completing too fast :-)
         - fixed a stall occuring between shortStreams and COMMAND
         - optimized pipe startup time in pipe.class and via the compiler.
         - optimized rc, commit, deadlock, threadpool code
   0.39  - Released August 9, 1998
         - WAIT_COMMIT and WAIT_ANY are now used in the call/addpipe logic
         - callpipe was not notifiing its pipe when ending leading to an
           very intermitant hang.
   0.38  - Released August 3, 1998
         * All your stages must be recompiled.  Recompile your pipes to
           exploit the pipe & thread pool performance improvements.
         - fixed and optimized commit logic.
         - implement a pool for pipes to decrease overhead.
         - implement a pool for threads to decrease overhead.
         - compiler fix to proprogate return codes from stageExits (thanks Jeff).
         - signal StageError('...  in all stageExits modified to
           signal StageError(13,'Error - 'pInfo' - ...
         - UNIQUE stage added by Jeff.  It exploits stageExit.
         - COMMAND stage was not starting its threads correctly.
         - SORTs in different pipes could corrupt each other.  Thanks René‚
   0.37  - Released July 25, 1998
         * A recompile of pipes using SORT is required
         - added NOEOFBACK, TOTARGET and FRTARGET.
         - removed a protected method from dump(), added arg() to the dump
         - upgraded SORT, sortRexx to exploit IRange and stageExit, optimized
           use, and factored the sort algorithm out of sort/sortRexx.
         - multiple sort stages no longer try to share static variables...
         - the compiler just uses the stage name (not args) when naming stages
   0.36  - Released July 19, 1998
         * A recompile of ALL pipes with stages using IRANGE is required.
           (CHANGE, DEAL, JOINCONT, LOCATE, LOOKUP, PICK, XLATE & ZONE)
         * pipes using NFIND, NLOCATE, STRNFIND or SORT also need to be
           recompiled
         - Added BuildIRangeExit and other methods to an updated IRange
           class.  Using 'zone range stage ...' will be faster than
           'stage range ...' when the range consists of n.c or n-c (s).
         - NFIND, NLOCATE, STRNFIND implemented via stageExit and NOT
         - Fixed bugs in, JUXTAPOSE, FIND, STRFIND, SORT, COMMAND, CHANGE
         - The compiler was not calling stageExit in the correct order when
           several calls were needed to build the stage.  (zone w1 nfind..)
   0.35  - Released July 16, 1998
         - Jeff Hennick pointed out a bugglet that effected LOOKUP, ZONE and
           PICK that could occur with complex ranges, I found another bug in
           strliteral
         - Jeff Hennick updated this doc with information on IRange and DString
   0.35  - Released July 15, 1998
         * A recompile of ALL pipes using ZONE, TCPCLIENT, TCPDATA, PREFIX
           and APPEND is required.
         - prefix and append can now be labeled, tcpclient and tcpdata
           now use a stage, instead of a pipe, to group data.
         - added compiler support for negitive stream numbers.  This is
           intended to be used by stageExit.  See append, prefix, tcpdata
           and tcpclient.
         - Redefined rexxArg() and stageArg() to simplify the compiler.
         - selection stages are no longer defined as final.
         - SelectInput(0) and selectOutput(0) are always called by the
           stage implementation so they can be overridden...
         - Reimplemented ZONE using stageExit, added CASEI using the same
           technique.  In theory NOT could be done the same way but, to
           avoid some recursion problems NOT is staying in the compiler.
         - StageExit modified to allow it to pass back another stage to
           call.  see ZONE, CASEI and NOT.
   0.34  - Released July 11, 1998
         - minor reportEOF(any) logic fix
         - improved command stage, threads used to process stdout and stderr.
           added zone, pad, lookup, pick, upgraded juxtapose, fixed bugs in
           specs & buffer.
         - added pad option to setIRange method
   0.33  - Released July 5, 1998
         - added rexxArg() and stageArg() methods to utils.nrx for use by the
$          compiler to query stages about what they expect their arguments to
           contain.  This allowed the compiler to be simplified.
$        - locate now handles null arguments correctly.  literals now include
           leading blanks.  Thanks for pointing out the problem René.
         - René Jansen contributed the timestamp stage.
         - logic modified to stop output() from getting an EOF when the output
           object has been peeked.  The peek status is also displayed by the
           dump() method and hense by deadlocks.
         - minor specs bug fixes (next.n and nextw.n output specs now work)
         - modified the compiler to invoke stageExit(rexx,rexx) method.  This
           allows stages to generate code and/or change the pipe topology.  See
           specs, append, prefix, change and xnop, in the stages directory.
         - modified StageError in preparation for usage changes.
         - removed the Range class - Jeff's code is better and anything that
           could be done with Range can be done using stageExit.
         - Jeff fixed bugs in change and join and added:
           fblock          joincont        notinside       outside
           inside
   0.32  - Released June 20, 1998
           Jeff updated these stages adding a few new ones too:
           abbrev          between         split           locate
           nlocate         strnfind        strfind         nfind
           find            chop
         - minor docuementation updates
         - the Range class is depreciated and will be removed.  Use the
           replacements Jeff created (see pipes\utils.nrx and stages\).
   0.31  - Released June 17, 1998
         - modified count, drop, take and deal to handle non rexx objects
           when possible
   0.31  - Released June 16, 1998
         - improved eofReport(ANY) logic to trigger when waiting on output
           and a different output stream severs.
         - factored the source for utils.class out of stages so there is
           a class to add (probably static) shared methods for all stages
         - fixed a deadlock that occured between shortStreams and exit
           (severInput)
         - Jeff Hennick updated many stages to work at CMS or near CMS levels.
           append          deal            join            strfrlabel      xlate
           buffer          drop            literal         strliteral
           change          fanin           locate          strtolabel
           console         fanout          split           take
           count           frlabel         strfind         tokenize
           All of Jeff's changes are GNUed.  See CopyLeft.txt in the njpipes
           directory.
   0.30  - Released May 24, 1998
         - fixed logic in core classes to post all pending severs and not
           clear them too early either, this corrects a problem seen on
           Multiprocessor machines.
   0.29  - www page update (docuemention) May 20
         - deadlock section updated
         - installation verification example corrected!
   0.29  - Released May 17, 1998
         - added obj2rexx stage, tolabel stage courtesy of Chuck Moore.
         - enhanced change to support a single range
         - Added setJITCache(Hashtable) method to pipes.  This can be used
           to build a global object cache in programs calling pipes.  The name
           of the Hasttable is passed to pipe/callpipe/addpipe via a cache
           parameter.
         - Added support for reportEof options.  This support is not too
           well tested - some good testcases are needed.
   0.28  - Released May 9, 1998
         - Enhanced parsing in specs (word2.1 would work, word 2.1 would not)
         - Fixed COPY for a NT jit bug, fixed locate so NOT LOCATE would
           work, updated LITERAL not to use more than one exit(rc)
         - Fixed a compiler problem that would hit multistreamed pipes using
           append or prefix.
         - Any options not consumed by njp are passed on to nrc
           and java.  Mainly for use from the command line, use with care
           in .njp files...
         - Fixed shortStreams() so it works correctly when shorting streams
           in a stage with multiple streams.
         - Tested all 8 addpipe forms and fixed runtime to work with all
           test cases
         - modified filternjp to accept *in and *out without additional labels
         - reenabled stop() in exit code...
         - added gate, dam, tokenize, juxtapose and courtesy of Chuck Moore,
           frlabel stages
   0.27  - Released May 3, 1998
         - Automated the generation of in/outStream calls.  For this to work
           the labels need to be of the form *in0: or *out0: where the '0' is
           replaced by the input or output stream to connect to.
         - Fixed compiler/filter problems with stema
         - Tighted range checking code in specs, fixed problem with delimited
           ranges.  Specs was compiling the NetRexx EXIT command...
         - Fixed a problem where output was not see that objects were
           consumed when using sipping pipes...
         - Fixed a problem where severing an output stream did not cause the
           stages stacked on the node's outlist to see the sever
         - Fixed a problem where the stage issuing a callpipe was not seeing
           the called pipe end
         - Added debug option to pipes compiler
         - Repaired commit and added commit levels to dump() method
         - Fixed problems with callpipe servering several outputs, unstacking
           the saved stream was selecting it...
         - Modified tcpclient and tcpdata to use a secondary thread to
           recieve the tcpip inputs.
         - Now keep a referenced object for each pipe/stage so the JIT does
           not throw away its work and call/addpipes in loops work faster.
         - in/outStreamState now return -1 when autocommit is enabled and
           the stream is unused.
   0.26  - Released April 26, 1998
   - Added selection methods to compiler (see getRange in section 4 and
           the locate stage an example#
         - Added the specs stage.  The compiler builds a stage to process the
           specs, reducing overhead.
         - Added tcp/ip stages
         - Fixed problems with severs using addpipe
   0.25  - Optimized some stages using jinsight from www.alphaworks.ibm.com.
           This more that doubled the speed of some stages.
         - fixed bugs in fanin, diskw
         - Added netrexx filters to extract pipes, extended the functions
           of .njp files (multiple pipes in a file and .njp files can now
           contain netrexx code with pipe/callpipe/addpipe)
         - fixed a timing bug in deadlock detection.
         - xlate and sqlselect stages contributed by René Jansen added
   0.24  - Release Feb 98
         - modified the compiler so the syntax of pipes from the command line
           is the same as pipes from .njp files
         - added the sort stage, the sortClass interface and the sortRexx
           example implementation
         - added the timer stage
   0.23  - fixed minor compiler errors (20 Dec 97)
         - not stage modifier added.
         - errors in this page corrected, NT install information added.
         - modified diskr/diskw to use Buffered Streams.
   0.22  - second public release
   0.21  - enabled auto commit, stages start at a commit level of -2 and
           commit to a level of -1 at the first readto, peekto or output.
           nocommit disables the auto commit.  This feature has not been
           completely tested (yet).
         - fixed compiler not to call netrexx if one of its pipes deadlocks
   0.20  - Upgraded to May version of the NetRexx compiler (Thanks Mike!)
           this changed the compiler interface.  NetRexx from May 10 or
           later is now required.
         - nocommit added to _stages, though its a nop for now
         - modified the compiler class to use the May 10th NetRexx compiler
   0.19  - initial public release (4 May 97)
