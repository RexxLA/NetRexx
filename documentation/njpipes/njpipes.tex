\chapter{Introduction}
A Pipeline, or Hartmann Pipeline\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartmann_pipeline}}, is a concept that extends and improves pipes as they are known from Unix and other operating systems. The name pipe indicates an interprocess communication mechanism, as well as the programming paradigm it has introduced. Compared to Unix pipes, Hartmann Pipelines offer multiple input- and output streams, more complex pipe topologies, and a lot more.
Pipelines were first implemented on VM/CMS, one of IBM's mainframe operating systems. This version was later ported to TSO to run under MVS and has been part of several product configurations. Pipelines are widely used by VM users, in a symbiotic relationship with REXX, the interpreted language that also has its origins on this platform.
njPipes is the implementation of Pipelines for the Java Virtual machine. It is written in NetRexx and Stages can be defined using this language. The resulting code can run on every platform that has a JVM (Java Virtual Machine). This portable version of Pipelines was started by Ed Tomlinson in 1997, when NetRexx was still very new, and was open sourced in 2011, soon after the NetRexx translator itself.
Pipeline principles
There are several introductions into the art of plumbing, that is, handling sources, pipes and sinks. In the following paragraph, a very condensed version is presented, just to set the stage for this publication.

\chapter{A Quick Tour of njPipes}
njPipes enables us to follow the usage model of CMS Pipelines closely; in fact, the documentation for the mainframe product can be used for most stages. In a later chapter, the stages that are delivered with njPipes are documented in a delta-approach, listing the differences with the mainframe product, if any.
Installation and verification
To run Pipes for NetRexx and Java you need both Java and NetRexx runtime support installed.  To write your own pipes or stages you need compilers for both Java and NetRexx. 
The core classes for pipes and stages are in njpipesC.jar.  This file may be used on the -cp option or added to your CLASSPATH.
To install create an njpipes directory, cd into it and unzip njpipes.zip. Then unzip the versioned njpipes file, unzip njpipes060.zip.  This will build the directory structure with with examples, documentation, the njpipesC.jar, and the commands pipe.bat, pipe.cmd, pipe.sh and pipe in the bin subdirectory. The environment variable NJPIPES\_HOME should point to the directory that contains njpipesC.jar.
To test the installation, we can run a pipeline from the command line.
Running a pipeline from the command line
 To run a pipeline from the commandline, type:
\begin{verbatim}
pipe "(test) literal arg() ! dup 999 ! count words ! console"
\end{verbatim}
The first time you use the pipe command in a new directory it will create a default pipes.cnf file for you. If you have the njpipesC.jar on your CLASSPATH you can also use:
java org.netrexx.njpipes.pipes.compiler (test) literal arg() ! dup 999 ! count words ! console
You should see a message that the pipe compiler is processing your pipe and soon after that messages from the NetRexx compiler as it processes the pipe.
To run the pipe type:
\begin{verbatim}
java test some words
\end{verbatim}
The pipe should then output:
\begin{verbatim}
 2000
\end{verbatim}

\chapter{Developing your own stages in NetRexx}
Writing your own pipes or stage is simple.  Take a look at the source of the supplied stages in the stages directory.  Here are some more examples.  The first shows how to use a pipe in a NetRexx program:
    -- examples/testpipe.njp
    -- to compile use: pipe testpipe.njp
    --             or: java njp testpipe.njp
    -- to execute use: java testpipe some text
\begin{lstlisting}
 class testpipe

    method testpipe(avar=Rexx)

       F = Rexx 'abase'
       T = Rexx 1

       F[0]=5
       F[1]=222
       F[2]=3333
       F[3]=1111
       F[4]=55
       F[5]=444

       pipe (apipe stall 1000 )
         stem F ! sort ! prefix literal {avar} ! console ! stem T

       loop i=1 to T[0]
          say 'T['i']='T[i]
       end

    method main(a=String[]) static

       testpipe(Rexx(a))
\end{lstlisting}
 A couple things can be inferred from this example.  First its simple to pass rexx variables to pipes using STEM.  Also look at the  phrase {avar}. It passes the Rexx variable's value to the stage at runtime.  In CMS the pipe would be quoted and you would unquote sections to get a similiar effect.
Another thing to note is that the pipe extraction program is fairly smart. It detects when pipes takes several lines.  As long as there are stages, or the current line ends with a stagesep or stageend character, or the next line starts with a stagesep or stageend character.  It gets added to the pipe.
The arg(), arg(rexx) or arg(null) methods get the arguments passed to a stage or pipe.  To get the complete rexx string of an argument use arg(). To get the nth word of a rexx argument use arg(n).  When using pipes in netrexx or java code you can use arg('name') to get the named argument. If the class of the arguement is not rexx use arg(null) to get the object.
In .njp files you can use {avar} phrase actually just shorthand for  arg('avar').
The following example shows what has to be done in a stage to access the rexx variables passed by VAR, STEM and OVER.  The real  over stage is a bit more complete.
\begin{lstlisting}
    -- over.nrx
 class over extends stage final

    method run() public
        a = getRexx(arg())
      loop i over a
         output(a[i])
      catch StageError
         rc = rc()
      end
    
   exit(rc*(rc<>12))
\end{lstlisting}
 The getRexx method is passed the name of a string by the pipe.  In the previous example it would be passed A and would return an Object pointer to A in testpipe. If you wish to replace a stream this can be done using connectors.  For example look at the following fragment:
\begin{verbatim}
    -- examples\calltest.njp
    pipe (callt1) literal test ! calltest {} ! console
\end{verbatim}
\begin{lstlisting}
    import org.netrexx.njpipes.pipes.

    class calltest extends stage final

    method run() public

       do
          a = arg()

          callpipe (cp1) gen {a} ! *out0:

          loop forever
             line = peekto()
             output(line)
             readto()
          end

       catch StageError
          rc = rc()
       end

    exit(rc*(rc<>12))
\end{lstlisting}
Running the callt1 pipe with an argument of 10 would pass the 10 to calltest via {} and arg().  Then cp1's gen stage would be passed 'a' which is set to 10.  Since gen generate numbers in sequence, the console stage of callt1 would get the numbers from 1 to 10.  Now cp1 ends and calltest's output stream is restored and calltest unblocks and reads the the literal's data 'test' and passes it to console.

The use of {} only works when compiling from .njp files.  It will not work from the command line.
The njpipes compiler recognizes connectors as labels with the following forms:
\begin{verbatim}
    *in:
   *inN:
   *out:
   *outN
\end{verbatim}

When N is a whole number, the connector connects input or output stream N of the stage with the connector.
When the label *in or *out, the connector connects the stages's current input or output stream with the connector.  This is used instead of *: due to the way the compiler/preprocessor works.
If you do not want the stage to wait for the called pipe to complete you can use addpipe.  Here is an example.
\begin{lstlisting}
    -- similar to examples\addtest.njp

    a  = 100
    b  = 'some text for literal'

    addpipe (linktest) literal {b} ! dup {a} ! *in0:

    loop forever
       line = Rexx readto()
    catch StageError
    end
\end{lstlisting}
    readto() will get 'some text for literal' one hundred times.

A quick aside.  When writing stages remember that njPipes moves objects through pipes.  Use 'value = peekto()' instead of 'value = rexx peekto()' when ever possible.  Some of the supplied stages pass objects with classes other than rexx and forcing rexx will cause classCastExceptions. If a stage needs a rexx object try using the rexx stage modifier to attempt to convert the object.  Feel free to expand this stage, but please send me the updated version.

Serious stage writers will probably want to take a good look at the methods defined in pipes/utils.nrx.  There you will find various methods for parsing ranges.  You will also find the stub for the stageExit compiler exit.  It can be used to produce 'on the fly' code at compile time.  You can also use it to change the topology of the unprocessed part of the pipe.  The major use is to allow implementations of stages like prefix, append or zone.  Its also used to produce better performing stages, for an example see specs.
The compiler also queries the rexxArg() and stageArg() methods.  If your stage expects objects of class Rexx as arguments rexxArg() should return the number of variables expected.  If your stage expects a stage for an argument, stageArg() should return the word position of the stage.

To get a good idea of what can be done with pipes look at the tasktest pipe in the examples directory.  It, using code from Melinda Varins 'Cramming for the Journeyman Plumber Exam' paper,  implements the shell of a  multitasking server - using about eight stages.  The file examples/tcptask.njp contains an example of this technique being used.

\chapter{Deadlocks}
Pipes for NetRexx and Java detects deadlocks and outputs information to allow you to fix the problem.  Consider the following session:
\begin{verbatim}
    java njp (deadlock) literal test ! a: fanin ! console ! a:
    Pipes for NetRexx and Java version 0.33
    Copyright (c) E. J. Tomlinson , 1998.  All rights reserved.
    Building pipe deadlock
    NetRexx portable processor, version 1.140
    Copyright (c) IBM Corporation, 1998.  All rights reserved.
    Program deadlock.nrx
    Compilation of 'deadlock.nrx' successful

    njpipes/examples]java -nojit deadlock
    test
    Deadlocked in deadlock

    Dumping deadlock Monitored by deadlock

     Flag units digit:  1=wait out, 2=wait in, 4=wait any, 8=wait commit
                     : 10=pending autocommit, 20=pending sever

     literal_1
     Running rc=0 commit=-1 Flag=201
     -> out 0 fanin_2 1 test

     fanin_2
     Running rc=0 commit=-1 Flag=101
     -> in  0 literal\_1 1 test
        in  1 console\_3 0 test
     -> out 0 console\_3 1 test

     console_3
     Running rc=0 commit=-1 Flag=101
     -> in  0 fanin\_2 1 test
     -> out 0 fanin\_2 0 test

    Dumped Pipe deadlock Flag 40F rc=16

    RC=16
\end{verbatim}

We can see that there are three stages Running.  None have any return codes set.  The Flags tell us that all the stages are waiting for an output to complete.  The '->' show which stream is selected.  From this we can see console\_3 is trying to output to fanin\_2. Unfortunately fanin\_2 is waiting for output on stream 0 to complete, it cannot read the datawaiting on in stream 1.  Hence the stall.
When a stream has data being output, there is a boolean flag following the name of the stage the stream is connected to. This tracks the peek state of the object.  For an output stream, true means the following stage has peeked at the value. With input streams, the current stage has seen the value when its true.
When a stage is multithreaded, like elastic, you can get flags of 3 or 5. This means that threads are waiting on output and read, or output and any. When using multithreaded stages, only one thread should use output unless it is serialized using protected or syncronized blocks.
When a stage has a pending sever or autocommit flag bits are set too.

\chapter{The Pipe Compiler}
\chapter{Stages}
This section describes the set of built in stages, i.e. the ones that are delivered with the downloadable open source package. These stages are directly executable from the njpipesC.jar file; also, the source of these stages is delivered in the package.
General notes on the built-in stages:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The underlying technology, the JVM, and the chosen implementation language, NetRexx, cause the character representation to be Unicode.
\item Most of the stages expect the objects in the pipeline to be of type Rexx
