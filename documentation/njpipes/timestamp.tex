Type:  Filter.


Syntax Description:  The arguments are optional.  The default is 8.


Operation:  A 16-character timestamp is developed whenever  a  record  has been  read.
It consists of the year (including the century), the month, day, hour, minute, second,
and hundredth  of  a  second.  Unlike CMS, the java interface reports hundredths of a
second.  The  specified number of characters are taken from the right-hand side of this
number and prefixed to the input record.
