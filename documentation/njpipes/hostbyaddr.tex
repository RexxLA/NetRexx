  HOSTBYADDR - Resolve a IP Address into an IP Hostname
   
     The input to HOSTBYADDR is a list of IP addresses.  
     For each IP address the corresponding hostname is determined using the system's name
     resolution method.  The resulting hostname is written to the output stream.

     (1) Optional parameter not present in VM/CMS version
   
         INCLUDEIP          - Also include the IP address along with the hostname.
                                   Output:   <hostname>/<ip address>
                                   Example:  dns.google/8.8.8.8
   
     Known issues:  The underlying Java method getByName/getHostName does not appear to handle IPv6 addresses 
                    in any known and consistent manner.  Could be related to a host configuration
                    issue but googling shows odd and inconsistent results for getting around this.  
   
     Examples:
   
      pipe "literal 1.1.1.1 | hostbyaddr | console"
      one.one.one.one
   	  
      pipe "literal 8.8.8.8 | hostbyaddr includeip | console"
      dns.google/8.8.8.8
   
      pipe "literal 1.1.1.255 | hostbyaddr | console"
      # Input record 1: Unable to determine host name for IP address 1.1.1.255 #
      
      pipe "literal 999 | hostbyaddr | console"
      # Input record 1: 999 is not a valid IP address #
   	  
      pipe "literal 2001:4860:4860::8888 | hostbyaddr | console" 
      # Input record 1: Unable to determine host name for IP address 2001:4860:4860::8888 #
   
      pipe "literal 999.999.999.999 | hostbyaddr | console"
      # Input record 1: Unable to determine host name for 999.999.999.999 . Check format of IP address provided. #
