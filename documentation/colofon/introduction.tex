\chapter{Introduction}
This is the meta-book that explains about how to make the books for
the NetRexx Programming Series. It uses the same toolchain to
produce and build it. The overall approach is to keep this lean, and
instead of having side-to side examples, it has a 'use the source' way
of working - look at a feature you need or like, then look it up in
the .tex sourcefile to find out how it is produced. This at least
until we figure out the tag escaping that needs to be done for the
side-by-side examples.

Differences with the other book in this series (the \emph{real}
publications) include
\begin{enumerate}
\item a bogus ISBN (the one from the quickstart guide)
\end{enumerate}
