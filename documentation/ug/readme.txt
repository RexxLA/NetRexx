You are looking at the readme for the NetRexx 3.03GA package - NetRexx-3.03GA.zip

If you are new to NetRexx, please read the contents of the file
read.me.first, and the NetRexx Quick Start Guide (in a pdf in this package).


Changes with respect to release candidate 1 include:

- functional: a fix for issue NETREXX-108, adding default and static
  methods in interfaces that Java 8 allows
- a new level of the ecj compiler, as the previous level proved defective
- dropped the requirement for JVM 8 to build the compiler from source

Changes with respect to release candidate 2 include:

- a change to the windows command scripts to automatically add the
  NetRexxF.jar to the classpath environment variable, and to default
  to the ecj compiler so its classes are found.

RC3 and this GA release are identical except for small documentation changes.
