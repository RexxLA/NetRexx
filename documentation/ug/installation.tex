\chapter{Installation}
This chapter of the document tells you how to unpack, install, and test the NetRexx translator package. This will install documentation, samples, and executables. It will first state some generic steps that are sufficient for most users. The appendices contain very specific instructions for a range of platforms that NetRexx is used on. 
Note that to run any of the samples, or use the NetRexx translator, you must have already installed the Java runtime (and toolkit, if you want to compile NetRexx programs using the default compiler). 
The NetRexx samples and translator, as of version 3.01, will run on 
Java version 1.5 or later1. To do anything more than run NetRexx programs with the runtime package, a Java software development kit is required. You can test whether Java is installed, and its version, by trying the following command at a command prompt: 
    java –version
which should display a response similar to this: 
java version "1.6.0\_26"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0\_26-b03-383-11A511)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.1-b02-383, mixed mode)
