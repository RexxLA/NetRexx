This section of the document tells you how to use the
translator package.  It assumes you have successfully installed Java and
NetRexx, and have tested that the :m.hello.nrx:em. testcase can be
compiled and run, as described in the :a id=testing.:cit.Testing the
NetRexx Installation:ecit. section:ea..

The NetRexx translator may be used as a compiler or as an interpreter
(or it can do both in a single run, so parsing and syntax checking are
only carried out once).  It can also be used as simply a syntax checker.

When used as a compiler, the intermediate Java source code may be
retained, if desired.  Automatic formatting, and the inclusion of comments
from the NetRexx source code are also options.
