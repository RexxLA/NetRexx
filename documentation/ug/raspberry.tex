This install guide is different, in the sense that it describes the entire setup of the Raspberry Pi system, including NetRexx.

\subsubsection{Linux on ARM}
The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive computer, containing an ARM architecture CPU on a board the size of a credit card, which sells for \$35. It boots from an SD card, the kind you have in your digital camera. In a few small steps you can be up and running with Java and NetRexx. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Use an SD card of suitable size (and known brand)\footnote{Not all cards work; the large brands do. SanDisk Ultra SDHC 16Gig cards are verified to work.}, at least 2GB but 8 or 16 is advisable
\item Download the raspbian image from \url{http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads}
\item Hook up an SD Card writer (the one in your digital camera probably also works) to the USB port of your computer
\item While taking good care not to overwrite your harddisk, use \emph{dd} or, on Windows, \emph{Win32DiskManager} to write the image to the SD card. This takes a minute. Good instructions are at \url{http://elinux.org/RPi_Easy_SD_Card_Setup}
\item Now unpack the Raspberry Pi, connect the hdmi to a tv or via an hdmi-monitor cable to a monitor, connect a keyboard (mouse can be attached later, if at all), and connect the mini-usb adapter to the power socket. I used a spare plug from an old phone. It boots and gives a lot of Unix messages. The first boot is not very quick. Connect an ethernet cable to your router\footnote{The entire installation can be done without connection a monitor if so desired. You can find the Raspberry on your network by using \texttt{nmap}. Be sure to re-enable ssh when running raspi-config.}.
\item You land in the raspi-config system. Resize the partitions to fill your SD card. Change the password for the pi user, set the default locale, and enable ssh. You can worry with the other options later.
\item Note the IP address that the system received from DHCP
\item Login from another system, for example using Putty (for Windows) or use ssh pi@your.ip.add.ress (these are the numbers of an IP4 address)
\item Download the ARMhf Java JDK-8 from Oracle, and untar it.
\begin{verbatim}
-v /opt/java 
tar xvzf ~/jdk-8-ea-b36e-linux-arm-hflt-29_nov_2012.tar.gz (the filename changed) 
sudo mv -v ~/jdk1.8.0 /opt/java 
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/java/jdk1.8.0/bin/java" 1 
sudo update-alternatives --set java 
\end{verbatim}
\item Use scp or ftp (binary mode) to transmit the NetRexxC.jar to the system, or install the whole NetRexx package. There is an unzip command available
\item Set path and classpath as indicated earlier, and run NetRexx. You have the option to develop and compile on the Raspberry, or just upload class files to it.
\end{itemize}
