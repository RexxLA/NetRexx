\chapter{Introduction}
This document is the \emph{Quick Start Guide} for the reference implementation of
\nr{}. \nr{} is a \emph{human-oriented} programming language which makes
writing and using Java\footnote{Java is a trademark of Oracle, Inc.}
classes quicker and easier than writing in Java. It is part of the Rexx
language family, under the governance of the Rexx Language
Association.\footnote{\url{http.www.rexxla.org}} \nr{} has been
developed and was made available as a free download by IBM since 1995
and is free and open source since June 8, 2011.

In this Quick Start Guide, youâ€™ll find information on
\begin{enumerate} 
\item How easy it is to write for the JVM: A Quick Tour of \nr{}
\item Installing \nr{} 
\item Current restrictions.
\item Using the \nr{} translator as a compiler, interpreter, or 
  syntax checker 
\item Troubleshooting when things do not work as expected
\end{enumerate} 
The \nr{} documentation and software are distributed
by The Rexx Language Association under the \textsc{ICU} license. For
the terms of this license, see the included \textsc{LICENSE} file in
this package.

For details of the \nr{} language, and the latest news, downloads,
etc., please see the \nr{} documentation included with the package
or available at: \url{http://www.netrexx.org}.

\begin{shaded}\noindent
Starting with \nr{} 4, JDK versions 7 and higher are supported. In
this version, the Java Platform Module System (JPMS) is fully
supported. The translator, when used as compiler as well as in
interpreter mode, runs in all current versions of the JDK.
