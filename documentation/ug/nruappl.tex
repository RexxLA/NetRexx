\chapter{Using \nr{} for Web applets}
\index{Web applets, writing}
\index{applets for the Web, writing}

Web applets can be written one of two styles:
\begin{itemize}
\index{binary arithmetic, used for Web applets}
\item Lean and mean, where binary arithmetic is used, and only core
Java classes (such as \emph{java.lang.String}) are used.  This is
recommended for World Wide Web pages, which may be accessed by people
using a slow internet connection.
Several examples using this style are included in the \nr{} package
\index{NervousTexxt example}
\index{ArchText example}
(eg., \emph{NervousTexxt.nrx} or \emph{ArchText.nrx}).
\item Full-function, where decimal arithmetic is used, and advantage is
taken of the full power of the \nr{} runtime (Rexx) class.
This is appropriate for intranets, where most users will have fast
connections to servers.
An example using this style is included in the \nr{} package
\index{WordClock example}
(\emph{WordClock.nrx}).
\end{itemize}
If you write applets which use the \nr{} runtime (or any other Java
classes that might not be on the client browser), the rest of this
section may help in setting up your Web server.

\index{HTTP server setup}
\index{Web server setup}
\index{runtime/web server setup}
A good way of setting up an HTTP (Web) server for this is to keep all
your applets in one subdirectory.  You can then make the \nr{} runtime
classes (that is, the classes in the package known to the Java Virtual
Machine as \emph{netrexx.lang}) available to all the applets by
unzipping \nr{}R.jar into a subdirectory \emph{netrexx/lang} below
your applets directory.
\newline
For example, if the root of your server data tree is
\begin{verbatim}
D:\mydata
\end{verbatim}
 you might put your applets into
\begin{verbatim}
D:\mydata\applets
\end{verbatim}
and then the \nr{} classes (unzipped from \nr{}R.jar) should be in
the directory
\begin{verbatim}
D:\mydata\applets\netrexx\lang
\end{verbatim}

The same principle is applied if you have any other non-core Java
packages that you want to make available to your applets: the classes in
a package called \emph{iris.sort.quicksorts} would go in a subdirectory
below \emph{applets} called \emph{iris/sort/quicksorts}, for example.

Note that since Java 1.1 or later it is possible to use the
classes direct from the \nr{}R.jar file. Please see the Java documentation for details.
