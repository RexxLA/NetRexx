This is the NetRexx 3.02 package, released on June 25th, 2013.
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

NetRexx is a programming language derived from both Rexx and Java.
It is a dialect of Rexx that retains the portability and efficiency of
Java, while being as easy to learn and to use as Rexx.

This package contains the documentation, executables, and sample
programs for NetRexx.

Verifying the working of the NetRexx interpreter and translator
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The NetRexx package includes the NetRexx translator -- a Java
application which can be used for compiling, interpreting, or
syntax-checking NetRexx programs.  The procedure for installation is
briefly as follows (full details are given in the NetRexx Quick Start Guide):

  1. Ensure that you have Java installed and running.
     Try the command: 'java -version' to confirm this. 
     Download and install Java from www.java.com if it does not work.

  2. Create a file named hello.nrx in the directory that contains NetRexxF.jar,
     containing the line:
	say 'hello, netrexx world!'

  3. In this directory, verify the working of the interpreter with:
	java -jar NetRexxF.jar -exec hello

  4. Verify that you can create a .class file using the compiler with:
	java -Dnrx.compiler=ecj -jar NetRexxF.jar hello

This should create the file hello.class, to be executed with the command:
	java -cp NetRexxF.jar:. hello

(on windows, the colon (:) should be a semicolon (;) ).

The -jar directive tells the JVM to ignore the set classpath and to
start a method that is indicated in the jar metadata.This method is,
for the NetRexxF.jar: 

        java org.netrexx.process.NetRexxC

Now that you have seen that it works, you can use this method of
execution. Please take into account that you will have to add additional entries
to the -jar argument for all but the most trivial applications.

The NetRexx Quick Start Guide explains about more flexible ways of installing and 
using NetRexx, using the NetRexxC.jar library added to the CLASSPATH variable, 
and using the script (batch) files that are included in this distribution.

If you have any problems or errors in the above process, please read the
detailed instructions and problem-solving tips in the NetRexx Quick Start Guide,
which also contains instructions for installation on other OS platforms than Windows or Linux.
You can find this guide in the documentation directory.
