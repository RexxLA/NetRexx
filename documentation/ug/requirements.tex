\chapter{Requirements}
\nr{} \splice{java org.netrexx.process.NrVersion} runs on a wide variety of
hardware and operating systems; all releases are tested on (non-exhaustive):
\begin{enumerate}
\item Windows Desktop and Server editions, with OpenJDK, Oracle and
  IBM JVMs, GraalVM, Amazon Corretto, Azul ZuluJ OpenJDK
\item Linux, with OpenJDK, Oracle and IBM JVMs, GraalVM, Amazon
  Coretto, Azul ZuluJ OpenJDK, including Linux on Z.
\item macOS with OpenJDK,  Oracle JVM, GraalVM and Amazon Corretto
\item Android on ARM hardware with Dalvik virtual machine
\item z/OS, Linux on Z (tested on RHEL and SUSE), with IBM JVM, on Z
  Arch (IBM Mainframe).
\item The Raspberry Pi, using Raspbian Linux and its included JDK, or
  OpenJDK, or Ubuntu Linux for aarch64.
\end{enumerate}
\nr{} runs equally well on 32- or 64-bit JVMs. As the translator is
a command line tool, no graphics configuration is required, and
headless operation is supported. Care has been taken to keep the \nr{} runtime small.

The class file format, however, of the current release distribution,
is\splice{java VersionTest}.; for older formats, you
can build \nr{} yourself from source or request assistance from the development
team\footnote{see the NetRexx project at SourceForge.net} for a special build.
\begin{shaded}\noindent
Since \nr{} 3, \nr{} requires only a
JRE\footnote{Java Runtime Environment} for program development, where previously a
Java SDK\footnote{Software Development Kit} was required. For serious development
purposes a Java SDK is recommended, as the tools found therein might
assist the development process.
