\section{The R\textsc{exx}R\textsc{exx} class}\label{refrexxrexx}

The \code{RexxRexx} class contains a copy of every method of the \code{Rexx} class, but callable in a non-object-oriented manner, like is done in Classic R\textsc{exx}. In scripting mode, an automatic \code{uses RexxRexx} is added to the generated Class.
