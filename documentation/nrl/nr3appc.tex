This appendix documents the \textbf{netrexx.lang}
package, which includes the classes used for creating string objects of
type \textbf{Rexx} along with several classes that are often used
while running NetRexx programs.
 
This appendix describes the public methods and properties of these
classes, as implemented by the reference implementation.  It does not
include those "built-in"  Methods for NetRexx (see page \pageref{refbmeth}) 
strings:ea. in the \textbf{Rexx} class that form part of the
NetRexx language, or those classes and methods that are internal
"helper" components (which, for example, are used as
repositories for rarely-executed code).
 
The classes in the netrexx.lang package are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The  Exception classes (see page \pageref{refnlexcep}) 
\item  Rexx (see page \pageref{refnlrexx}) 
\item RexxIO (helper class, for \texttt{say} and \texttt{ask})
\item RexxNode (helper class, for indexed strings)
\item  RexxOperators interface (see page \pageref{refnlrops}) 
\item RexxParse (helper class, for \texttt{parse})
\item  RexxSet (see page \pageref{refnlrset}) 
\item RexxTrace (helper class, for \texttt{trace})
\item RexxUtil (helper class, for the Rexx class)
\item RexxWords (helper class, for the Rexx class)
\end{itemize}
