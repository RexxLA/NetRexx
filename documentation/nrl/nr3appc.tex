This appendix documents the \textbf{netrexx.lang}
package, which includes the classes used for creating string objects of
type \textbf{R\textsc{exx}} along with several classes that are often used
while running \nr{} programs.
 
This appendix describes the public methods and properties of these
classes, as implemented by the reference implementation.  It does not
include those "built-in"  Methods for \nr{} (see page \pageref{refbmeth}) 
strings:ea. in the \textbf{R\textsc{exx}} class that form part of the
\nr{} language, or those classes and methods that are internal
"helper" components (which, for example, are used as
repositories for rarely-executed code).
 
The classes in the netrexx.lang package are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The  Exception classes (see page \pageref{refnlexcep}) 
\item  R\textsc{exx} (see page \pageref{refnlrexx}) 
\item R\textsc{exx}IO (helper class, for \keyword{say} and \keyword{ask})
\item R\textsc{exx}Node (helper class, for indexed strings)
\item  R\textsc{exx}Operators interface (see page \pageref{refnlrops}) 
\item R\textsc{exx}Parse (helper class, for \keyword{parse})
\item  R\textsc{exx}Set (see page \pageref{refnlrset}) 
\item R\textsc{exx}Trace (helper class, for \keyword{trace})
\item R\textsc{exx}Util (helper class, for the R\textsc{exx} class)
\item R\textsc{exx}Words (helper class, for the R\textsc{exx} class)
\end{itemize}
