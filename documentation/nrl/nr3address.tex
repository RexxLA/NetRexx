The keyword \emph{address} temporarily or permanently changes the destination of commands. Commands are strings sent to aan external environment. You can send commands by specifying clauses consisting of only an expression or by using the ADDRESS instruction.

To send a single command to a specified environment, code an environment, a literal string or a single symbol, which is taken to be a constant, followed by an expression. The environment name is the name of an external procedure or process that can process commands. The expression is evaluated to produce a character string value, and this string is routed to the environment to be processed as a command. After execution of the command, environment is set back to its original state, thus temporarily changing the destination for a single command.
