The \keyword{interpret} instruction is used to process instructions at run-time.
Expression is evaluated and interpreted within the current context of the running program.

The expression must be one or more valid clauses separated by a semicolon \textbf{;}, syntactically correct, properly ended - in short,
anything that may be written within a \keyword{do} block.

When this is not the case, the keyword{interpret} instruction will signal an InterpretException exception.

The \keyword{interpret} instruction has read-write access to properties and variables, and can invoke methods
on these (when visibility and modifier attributes are suitable). New variables can be declared and worked with within
the \keyword{interpret} instruction, but are inexistent after the instruction.

The following examples show some of the capabilities:

\begin{lstlisting}
FRED=''
data='FRED'
interpret data '= 4'
say FRED
\end{lstlisting}
will output '4'.

You can even interpret the \keyword{interpret} instruction, as in:

\begin{lstlisting}
FRED=''
interpret "data = 'FRED'; interpret  data '= 4';"
say FRED
\end{lstlisting}
which will also output '4'.

Loop constructs must be complete:

\begin{lstlisting}
interpret  'loop for 3; say "Hello there!"; end'
\end{lstlisting}
will send its greetings three times.

The \keyword{return} instruction is not supported and generates an InterpretException exception.

Likewise, signaling exceptions is not supported in the \keyword{interpret} instruction, and starting threads from the instruction
is nondeterministic and unpredictable and should be avoided.
