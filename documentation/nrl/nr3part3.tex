\chapter{\nr{} Language Definition}\label{refpart3}
\index{\nr{},language definition}
 
This part of the document describes the \nr{} language, version \nrversion{}.
This version includes the original \nr{} language
\footnote{
The \nr{} Language, M. F. Cowlishaw,
ISBN 0-13-806332-X, Prentice-Hall, 1997
}
together with additions made from 1997 through 2000 and previously
published in the \emph{\nr{} Language Supplement}.
 
The language is described first in terms of the characters from which it
is composed and its low-level syntax, and then progressively through
more complex constructions.
Finally, special sections describe the semantics of the more
complicated areas.
 
\index{Reference implementation,}
\index{Java,in reference implementation}
Some features of the language, such as \keyword{options} keywords and
binary arithmetic, are implementation-dependent.  Rather than leaving
these important aspects entirely abstract, this description includes
summaries of the treatment of such items in the \emph{reference
implementation} of \nr{}.  The reference implementation is based
on the Java environment and class libraries.
 
\emph{Paragraphs that refer to the reference implementation,
and are therefore not strictly part of the language definition, are
shown in italics, like this one.}
