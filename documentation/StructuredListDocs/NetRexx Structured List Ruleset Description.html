<h3 style="text-align: center;">NetRexx Structured List Ruleset Description</h3>


<font color="#3333ff"><br>
A list ruleset specifies a set of delimiters and options and can be
provided in one of four ways:<br>
<br>
(1) A null ruleset (or the string "default") signifies a default
ruleset. Default rules are start/end delimiters "(" and ")", a separator "
" (a blank), an escape character " (double quote), and the option "escape is quoted string mode".<br>
<br>
(2) A string such as "CSV", which is a well known list format name,
selects a built-in ruleset. For example, a list in CSV format could be
decoded like this: inputlist=inputstring.getlist("CSV"). Formats known to a Structured List include "WORDLIST", "DSV",
"CSV", "TSV",
"XML", "JSON", "PYTHON".<br>
<br>
(3) A string which provides a human readable custom set of list rules
that is itself a decomposable list according to the default ruleset.
Rulsets contain two sections- delimiters and options which are
specified as separate sublists as in the following example: <br>
<br>
'delimiters(start("&lt;") end("&gt;") separator(",") meta("/")
escape("\\") nameseparator("=") )
options(separators-must-follow-sublists "adjacent separators reduce to
one")' <br>
<br>
(4) A ruleset string that is itself an encoded list according to a
known ruleset can simply be preparsed before use like in this example:
inputlist=inputstring.buildlist(rulesetstring.buildlist("default"))</font><br>

<h4>Delimiters</h4>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Any type of delimiters can be specified
but the following (along with the ruleset options) define the structure
of a list. Other delimiters can be provided and will be recognized and
recorded as list elements when they occur which means they are
"defacto" separators for the list elements.<br>
</div>


<br>


Start<br>


<br>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A delimiter which signals the start of
a sublist. Example: start("{")<br>
</div>


<br>


End<br>


<br>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A delimiter which signals the end of a
sublist. Example: End("}")<br>
</div>


<br>


Escape <br>


<br>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">An escape character used to include
delimiters in the list data elements. Example: escape("\\")<br>
</div>


<br>


Separator<br>


<br>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A delimiter used to separate list
elements. Example: Separator(",")<br>
</div>


<br>


NameSeparator<br>


<br>


<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A delimiter used to associate element
names with element values. Example: Namesep("=")<br>
</div>


<h4>Options</h4>


The following options are recognized (A "0" in front of the option
indicates a default value and a "1" indicates an option which overrides
the default value. The additional descriptions in parenthesis are not
part of the option. Options can be specified as quoted text or with
dashes substituted for spaces. Options can be abbreviated as long as
they are unique. Options are not case-sensitive.<br>


<br>


option 1:<br>


0 = separators follow sublists<br>


1 = sublists are separators<br>


option 2:<br>


0 = adjacent separators reduce to one<br>


1 = produce empty elements for adjacent separators<br>


option 3:<br>


0 = translate escape sequences<br>


1 = do not translate escape sequences<br>


option 4:<br>


0 = whitespace is translated to blank (TAB,FF,LF,CR,VT)<br>


1 = treat whitespace as text<br>


option 5:<br>


0 = escape is quoted string mode (ie "text, delimiters or double escape
like this: "" more text")<br>


1 = single character escape (ie \x)<br>


option 6:<br>


0 = attribute names are implicit (ie fun(x,y) )<br>


1 = explicit attribute names (ie with delimiter as in fun=(x,y) or
fun:(x,y) )<br>


option 7:<br>


0 = delimiters are implicit (do not record structural delimiters)<br>


1 = tokens are delimiters (save delimiters as separate elements)<br>


option 8:<br>


0 = keep leading and trailing whitespace<br>


1 = strip leading and trailing whitespace<br>
