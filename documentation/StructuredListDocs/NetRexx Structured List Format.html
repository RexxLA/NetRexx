<h3 style="text-align: center;">NetRexx Structured List Format</h3>
A structured list is an ordered sequence of items stored in a NetRexx
native data object (class Rexx) along with "meta data" describing the
list. Each element of the list can be accessed with a whole number
ranging from 1 to n where n is the number of elements in the list. The
string encoded (aka "serialized") form of the string is the base value
of the Rexx object. If an element of a list is itself a list (ie a
nested list), then elements of the sublist can also be accessed by
whole number indexes so that for example the 3rd element of the nested
list which is the second element of the first list could be found at
myList[2,3] where myList is the object containing the structured
list. Note that although a structured list is a Rexx object, changing
the list directly rather than through the StructuredList interface
methods will cause loss of metadata and unpredictable results for
further list access. To remove the meta-data from the list use the
"flatlist()" method which returns a Rexx object that is a "Map" from
integers to list elements - this allows use of "loop over" to traverse
the list elements or "values()" to obtain a collection of the list
elements.<br>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Accessing structured lists with NetRexx facilities</h3>

<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Assuming myList is a Rexx object containing a structured list, then:<br>
</div>

<br>

myList[n,m]<br>

<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
A list element can be accessed by numeric index using NetRexx indexed
variable syntax. If the element is also a list, sub-elements can be
accessed using the multiple index syntax.<br>
</div>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
Additional indexed values are described below:<br>
<dl></dl>The
following indexes must be prefixed with "#" to use if they are whole
numbers according to the NetRexx datatype BIF - this avoids conflict
with list index numbers.<br>
<dl>

  <dt>elementname</dt>
  <dd>If an element has a name, using the name as an index will return the associated element value.<br>
    <br>
  </dd>
  <dt>element</dt>
  <dd>The element string will return the index of the first location of that element in the list.<br>
</dd>
</dl>
elementvalue<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">If an element has a name the named value string will return the index of the first location of that value in the list.<br>
