process
-------

This is the directory for the source (and builder) for the NetRexx
translator/compiler.  Also here is nrc.prp -- the source for the
NetRexxC.properties error messages resource

Class files generated from source here will end up in:

   COM.ibm.netrexx.process

---------------

Run BUILD.CMD to build all class files that need building.

Class files should be erased before BUILDing to avoid ambiguous class
references (BUILD will do this).
