;; Comentary: 

;; After working for roughly a year with an adapted REXX-mode, I decided
;; it was time for a dedicated netrexx-mode. Particularly, the
;; indentation engine was beyond my simple elisp comprehension and it
;; had a few oddities that made it less than perfect. Taking the
;; mode-tutorial on emacs wiki as a starting point, I built this mode
;; from scratch.
;;

;; Inspiration:

;; The main inspiration for writing this file as it is came from the
;; mode-tutorial by Scott Andrew Borton ( http://two-wugs.net/scott/
;; ), which I found on emacs-wiki.
;; The idea for the command netrexx-select-current-block was taken
;; from rexx-mode.el by Anders Lindgren / James Perrin.  
;; The idea for a NetRexx pull-down menu and how to implement it was
;; taken straight from fortran.el.  Stefan Monier helped when I was
;; stuck by answering some questions on news://gnu.emacs.help

;;
;; Usage:
;;	This file contains code for a GNU Emacs major mode for
;;	editing NETREXX program files.
;;
;;     Type C-h m in Emacs for information on how to configurate
;;	the netrexx-mode.
;;
;;	Put the following lines into your .emacs and rexx-mode will be
;;	automatically loaded when editing a NETREXX program.  If
;;	netrexx-mode shall be used for files with other extensions you
;;	can create more (cons ...) lines with these extensions.
;;
;;	(autoload 'netrexx-mode "netrexx-mode" "NETREXX mode" nil t)
;;	(setq auto-mode-alist
;;	      (append
;;	       (list (cons "\\.nrx$"  'netrexx-mode)
;;		     (cons "\\.nry$"  'netrexx-mode)
;;	       	     )
;;	       auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; To have netrexx-mode indent two columns a time your new lines as
;; you type them, enter the following in your .emacs
;; (setq netrexx-mode-hook '(lambda ()
;; 			(setq netrexx-indent-amount 2)
;; 			(local-set-key "\C-m" 'netrexx-indent-newline-indent)
;; 			))
;;
;; Netrexx mode can automatically insert a little comment after the
;; keyword "end" indicating what it is ending. To do this, replace
;; 'netrexx-indent-newline-indent 
;; by
;; 'netrexx-indent-newline-indent-with-end-comment
;;
;; Functions that should make live a bit easier:
;;
;; M-x netrexx-sanitize-region
;;   To make sure that there are no unintentional "trace results" or
;;   "trace methods" statements in your cvs check in, select a region
;;   and use the commant M-x netrexx-sanitize-region on it. This will
;;   also change all white lines by a single one, and it will remove
;;   all trailing whitespace.
;;
;; M-x netrexx-select-current-block
;;   This will select all lines of the "block" point is in. A block is
;;   defined to start either with "do", "loop" or "select" and end
;;   with "end", or defined to be the current method when no
;;   surrounding "do", "loop", "select" with "end" is found.  For this
;;   command, the comments right before a method are considered to be
;;   part of that method.
;;
;; A note on indentation:
;; Netrexx has a human oriented syntax, meaning basically "anything
;; goes" for the lay-out. To get the fullest of the indentation
;; engine, it makes a few assumptions about the lay-out of
;; source-code:
;; Statements like "if", "else", "end", "loop" and "catch" should always 
;; be found as the first text on a line.

;; Bugs / To do: 
;; 1. When using continued lines in combination with
;;    statements like "then do", the indentation is wrong. 
;; 2. Other combinations of continued lines might prove to be wrong
;;    too.
;; 3. Auto-fill mode does not work. However, filling of comments with
;;    M-q works.
;; 4. M-q does not split coding lines at appropriate places with a
;;    continuation character. This is something that's low on my to
;;    do list.
;; 5. netrexx-insert-javadoc-for-method goes into a loop if a
;;    parameter name ends with more than one underscore (_).

;; HISTORY
;;     14-09-03 V2.0 AB         First version. Inspired by the ModeTutorial
;;                              on emacs wiki. Version number is 2.0, since
;;                              it replaces another netrexx-mode.
;;
;;     06-04-04 V2.1 AB         Added skeletons, some minor bug fixes in the
;;                              indentation code.

  "Indent the current line as NETREXX code.
The following rules apply:

 0- All keywords are matched from the beginning of the line.

 1- If we are at the beginning of the buffer, indent to column 0.

 2- If we see the keyword \"class\" without the keyword
    \"dependent\", then indent to column 0.

 3- If we see the keyword \"class\" with the keyword
    \"dependent\", then indent to `netrexx-indent-amount'.

 4- If we see the keyword \"method\" then indent to
    `netrexx-indent-amount'.

 5- If we see the keyword \"when\" or \"otherwise\", the indent
    amount is relative to the matching \"select\" statement, plus
    `netrexx-indent-amount'.

 6- If we look at the statement \"else\", indent it to the same
     amount as the corresponding \"if\", taking nested ifs into
     account.

 7- If we see the statement \"catch\" or \"finally\", look for
    the matching \"do\" and set the indent amount to the same as
    that \"do\". Take nested blocks into account. See rule 11 for
    a definition of a block start.

 8- \"end\" should be matched to the corresponding \"do\",
    \"loop\" or \"select\".

 9- The first line of a multi-line comment should be indented
    like a normal line. When the second line of a multi-line
    comment starts with a \"*\", then align that \"*\" with the
    first \"*\" of the first line of the multi-line comment,
    otherwise indent it so that it starts two positions after the
    \"*\" of the first comment line. This will make sure that the
    comment-text is aligned in a correct way.

10- If the previous non-empty line contains the uncommented
    keyword \"then\", then indent the next line. The line after
    that should not be indented, except when it is part of a
    \"do\"-construct.

11- If the previous line is ended with the continuation character
    \"-\", then find the first line with that continuation
    character. Find the characther \"(\" on that line and set the
    indentation to the next column. If the \"(\" couldn't be
    found, then look for the \" character and indent to there.

12- If a line follows a \"block\"-start, increase the indentation
    with `netrexx-indent-amount'.  A \"block\"-start consists of
    one of the following keywords: \"catch\", \"class\", \"do\",
    \"then\", \"else\", \"loop\", \"method\", \"select\" or
    \"otherwise\".  This should consider nested \"if\" constructs
    and do the right thing.

13- If we first see an \"do\"-construct ending, the we should
    indent the current line to the same indentation as the
    \"do\"-construct ending. Except when the keyword \"end\"
    matches a keyword \"do\" which comes right after an \"else\",
    \"then\" or \"otherwise\".

14- If no indentation rule matches, then indent the same amount
    as the previous line.

15- Javadoc comments should be indented to the same amount as the
    class or method they belong to."

"Major mode for editing NETREXX code.

Variable controlling indentation style:
 `netrexx-indent-amount'
	The basic indentation for do-blocks.

Variable controlling end-comments:
`netrexx-end-comment-treshold'
   Number of lines the matching block beginning has to be away from
   the end statement.

Turning on NETREXX mode calls the value of the variable
netrexx-mode-hook with no args, if that value is non-nil.

;;For example:
;; (setq netrexx-mode-hook  '(lambda ()
;;			 (setq netrexx-indent-amount 2)
;;			(local-set-key `\\C-m' 'netrexx-indent-newline-indent)
;;			))

Two extra keymappings are defined: 
C-c C-n maps to M-x `netrexx-next-method' and 
C-c C-p maps to M-x `netrexx-previous-method'.

For convenience it is possible to map
`netrexx-indent-newline-indent-with-end-comment' instead of
\\[netrexx-indent-newline-indent] to C-m in the above example. This
will place a small -- style comment right after every
\"end\"-statement, containing the matching do, if, et cetera
statement.

If the variable `netrexx-auto-insert-javadoc' is true, then invoking
`netrexx-indent-new-line-indent' or
`netrexx-indent-newline-indent-with-end-comment' on a line contatining
a method definition will insert a javadoc skeleton for that method.

A further convenience method is \\[netrexx-sanitize-region], which
will remove all non-single blank lines from the file. It will also
look for \"trace results\" and \"trace methods\" statements and
comment them if within 4 lines back no \"if\" statement is found.
