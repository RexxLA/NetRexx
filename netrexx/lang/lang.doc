This directory contains the source (and builder) for the netrexx.lang
classes, as follows

  RexxOperators -- interface class
  RexxStems     -- interface class

  Rexx          -- primary class
  RexxWords     -- words functions helper class

  .. etc ..

Run BUILD.CMD to build all class files that need building.

Class files should be erased before BUILDing to avoid ambiguous class
references (BUILD will do this).
