#11 This is the NetRexxC messages master file, which can be used
#12 directly as a java properties file or from which some new properties
#13 file (or other lookup database) can be generated or translated.
#14
#15 Each line is a single message (which allows the file to be sorted);
#16 the first word is the "key" (for example, 'cannot.extend.self') and
#17 the remainder is the 'human-readable' message, with inserts
#18 indicated as %1, %2, etc. (corresponding to the extra arguments
#19 supplied to RxError, etc.).  The inserts need not be be in ascending
#20 numerical order, and may be repeated if required.
#21
#22 Empty lines, and lines starting with '#' or blank, are ignored during
#23 processing.  The Java Properties class can use this file directly,
#24 though NetRexxC used its own class (which was a little over ten
#25 times faster, as measured 1996.11.02) until Java 1.1, since when it
#26 is used as a ResourceBundle.
